# DuecaTestCommunication, a DUECA Project

## Introduction

This is a very test project for DUECA, stressing channel writing and reading. It runs with [DUECA Middleware](https://github.com/dueca/dueca), do not clone directly but use DUECA's `dueca-project` script for that. 

## Application

This has no other application than testing DUECA communication.
