# A "node" is a computer participating in a DUECA distributed process
# Each node requires a specific configuration, e.g., to show instruments,
# out-of-the-window view, perform IO with hardware. The software
# configuration for a node (chosen modules, libraries) is determined by
# it's "machine class"
#
# The "machine class" thus indicates what part of the application runs on this
# computer, examples are control_loading, ig, efis
#
# Per machine class, specify what libraries to link, additional DUECA
# components, compile flags etc.

# This file is "sourced" when dueca_adapt_machine is called.

# extend DUECA_COMPONENTS with additional components
